I can't really express in words what you mean to me. To me you are my world; to me you are my everything. I just want to tell you one thing. I truly love you from my heart and soul. You know what; in my life you play the most important role. I may not tell you every day that you are my life. But, today I want to tell you that I love you lots and lots. My dear if I ever get a chance to choose my next birth, then I would ask God that I wanna be yours again and forever. I love you so much and I mean it.
